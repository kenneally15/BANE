## Why BANE
* Less than **5 %** of the USAF are rated officers; yet every Airman must grasp the "family business" of air-power.
* Great-Power Competition demands rapid, scalable tactical learning across the force.
* Traditional human-only debrief pipelines can’t meet demand—**BANE** scales Weapons School expertise to everyone.

## How It Works
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1  ›** | **Drag & Drop Scenario (PDF)** – Upload mission rules, assets, threats |
| **2  ›** | **Fly / Simulate Mission** – Solo or instructor-led playthrough |
| **3  ›** | **Upload Log (JSON)** – Drop generated gameplay log |
| **4  ›** | **Instant AI Debrief** – Timeline, causal analysis, graded focus points |
| **5  ›** | **Perception Analysis** – Optional eye-tracking stream pinpoints what the trainee saw vs. missed |

## Demo Walk-through
**Scenario:** INDOPACOM strike-package escort versus adversary naval group.

## Key Features
| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Event Extraction** | Parses mission logs into an ordered timeline of tactical events |
| **Causal Inference** | Links actions to outcomes using doctrinal rules and LLM reasoning |
| **Eye-Tracking Fusion** | Separates decision errors from perception gaps |

---

## Roadmap
- **RL Curriculum Learning** – Self-play data (à la KataGo) to evolve AI adversaries & coaching agents
- **Deep Causal Graphs** – Multi-layer reasoning across mission, perception, and comms
- **Personalized Mini-Games** – Micro-drills tuned to individual weaknesses
- **Additional Sensors** – Heart-rate, G-force, EEG for cognitive-load analysis

## Quick Start
```bash
 # Requires Python 3.13
 python3 --version
 python3 -m venv myenv
 source myenv/bin/activate
 pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
 
 # Launch back-end
 cd backend
 export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=Your Key
 uvicorn main:app --reload

 # Launch local web front-end
 # New terminal window / tab
 npm install
 npm run dev
```

Then open the browser and go to http://localhost:5173/   
Drag in an instructor PDF (`Wargame Scenario Considerations.pdf`)    
Fly the mission, and drop mission log JSON (`scenario1.json`) for instant debrief.
